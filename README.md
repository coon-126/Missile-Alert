# Missile-Alert

Description:
The Missile Alert System is a desktop widget developed using PyQt5, designed to provide real-time missile alert notifications. It accesses an online data source to fetch the latest alerts, which are then displayed in the widget window. The alerts are categorized into new and old, presented in two separate tables.

Upon receiving a new alert, the application plays a sound notification and presents a pop-up alert window at the center of the screen, instructing the user to seek shelter.

Right-clicking on the widget opens a context menu with several options:

1. Move the widget.
2. Test an alert notification.
3. Test the sound notification.
4. Mute or unmute the sound.
5. Exit the application.
This system serves as a real-time alerting tool to keep users informed about missile threats, allowing quick actions to be taken to ensure safety.
