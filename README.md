# Missile-Alert
The Missile Alert System is a desktop widget developed using PyQt5, designed to provide real-time missile alert notifications. It accesses an online data source to fetch the latest alerts, which are then displayed in the widget window. The alerts are categorized into new and old, presented in two separate tables.
